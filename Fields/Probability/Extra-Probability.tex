\section{Extra}

This section is a collection of interesting
results that are not conventional.
Some of them might be specially useful for Optimal Transport.

\subsection{Probabilities and Lipschitz Functions}

Here we point out the interesting relation between
probability measures with finite first moment and Lipschitz
functions. This is based on \citet{perrone2018categorical}.

\begin{theorem}
	Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space
\end{theorem}

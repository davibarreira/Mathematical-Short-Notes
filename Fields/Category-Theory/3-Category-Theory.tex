\section{$\mathbf{Poly}$ Category}

In the words of David Spivak, the $\mathbf{Poly}$ category is am exceptionally well-behaved
category that nicely describes dynamical systems and ``rewiring diagrams''.

There are many equivalent ways of defining $\mathbf{Poly}$. The informal
definition is that
\begin{definition}[Informal Definition of $\mathbf{Poly}$]
	$\mathbf{Poly}$ is the sum of representable functors $F:\mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}$.
\end{definition}

Remember that a representable functor is a functor that is naturally isomorphic
to a functor $y^A \equiv Mor_\mathbf{Set} (A,-)$ for some set $A$, i.e. $A \in Ob_\mathbf{Set}$.
Hence, an object in $\mathbf{Poly}$ is a sum of representable functors, e.g.
$y^A + y^B + y^C + y^C$.
Thus, we can now understand why the name $\mathbf{Poly}$... It is the category
of polynomials.

\section{Stochastic Optimal Control Application}

This section is focused in collecting some results from Stochastic Optimal
Control in order to solve problems in finance.

First, let's consider the problem which we are going to solve.
We start with an amount of wealth denoted by $X_0 = X_0^b + \pi_0$,
where $X_0^b$ is the amount of money in the bank and $\pi_0$ is the amount
of money in a risky asset. Now, as time passes, our wealth $X_t$ will change,

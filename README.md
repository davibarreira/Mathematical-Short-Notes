### :notebook: A collection of notes on a variety of Mathematical topics.

This repo is a collection of notes based on the courses I've been taking during
my masters and now my PhD, at FGV School of Applied Mathematics [EMAp](https://emap.fgv.br/).

I just started writing this recently, and I intend
to keep updating it as I study and revise subjects.
Some of the notes are in hand-written form, and I intend to
transcribe them to LaTeX. But this might take some time.

Some subjects are naturally programming oriented
and I intend to provide some code in Julia, which I find ideal
for mathematical modelling.

<!-- The most current version of the notes are in the -->
<!-- [*Mathematical Short Notes* book](https://github.com/davibarreira/Mathematical-Short-Notes/blob/master/Book/main.pdf). -->

## :file_folder: Content of the Repository
Here is a summary of what is in this repository (note that this
is not static, and I'll update as I write more stuff).

Each note uses different books are references, but I'll put here the main reference for each,
unless the note is really a mixture of things.

The percentage is related to how much I have written compared to what I still intend on writing about the subject,
and **not** how much of the subject is covered.

When appropriate, I'll try to write some Julia code inside each subject.

\chapter*{Preface}

This ``book'' is a collection of notes taken during my Masters and PhD on Mathematical Modelling
at FGV/EMAp. The main purpose is to better organize
the several subjects I've been studying, and avoid forgetting all together,
\textbf{specially} interesting proofs and results that I've found along the way.
I'm sharing this so my classmates can read the lecture notes, and also
so it might be useful to some random math student.

I started writing these notes as separate documents, but, Mathematics
is very intertwined, and it quickly dawned on me
that I was having to regularly repeat definitions, theorems,
proofs... Not to mention the issues related to trying to keep
a consistent notation across different documents.

Thus, I decided to put everything together in a book format,
while keeping the subjects somewhat compartmentalized.

The notes supposed to be an introduction to the many fields of Mathematics,
thus, there are almost no motivation nor many examples. The goal is instead
to present definitions and results of different areas in an organized manner.
Yet, this style is not really consistent across the book. Some chapters
just state results without proofs, while others not only have proofs,
but very ``wordy'' proofs.

Finally, the topics covered are really varied, and are based on the
courses I've taken. In some notes, there are also some code written
in Julia.
